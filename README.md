Project's Main Purpose and Technical Details:

The goal of your project was to manage reservations using a single entity called Booking. This entity allowed users to select dates and times and featured an impressive date selection algorithm.

Visual and User-Friendly Design:

Colorful and Informative: Users can easily distinguish between available and unavailable times with color-coded indicators. These colorful cues help users make quick and accurate selections.
User Notification: The application shows existing reservations for the dates and times users are trying to select, preventing conflicts and providing suitable alternatives.
Technical Details:

Reservation Conflict Prevention: Multiple reservations at the same date and time are prevented. This increases the accuracy and reliability of the system, ensuring that users only select available time slots.
Tailwind CSS and Symfony: The project features a modern and stylish design with Tailwind CSS and a robust backend structure using Symfony.
JavaScript and JSDOM: Extensive JavaScript and JSDOM scripting ensured that date and time selections are dynamically updated and accurate. This made the user interface interactive and high-performing.
